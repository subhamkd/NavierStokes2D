# NavierStokes2D
This repo contains a flow solver that solves the Navier Stokes equations for a 2D incompressible laminar flow in a rectangular domain. The solver was written using the "12-steps to Navier Stokes" tutorial by Professor Lorena Barba as given in Barba, Lorena A., and Forsyth, Gilbert F. (2018).
